    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3.5 cups of goat's ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of either honey or pomegrante, grape or date syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Bay leaves (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>Pine nuts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps to Make Libum:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, flour, egg, honey, pine nuts, and salt. Mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Bread:</strong> Form the dough into small rounds or patties. If using bay leaves, you can place a small piece of bay leaf under each round on the baking sheet for added flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Place the shaped dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Drizzle with Honey:</strong> Once baked, let the Libum cool slightly, then drizzle with additional honey before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>
