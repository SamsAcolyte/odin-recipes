    <p><strong>Mulsum</strong> – A sweetened beverage made by mixing honey with wine, usually served at the beginning of a meal as an apéritif. 
        It was a favorite in Roman banquets for its smooth and sweet taste.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bottle of white wine (preferably dry)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of honey (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        <li>A few black peppercorns (optional, for spiciness)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to Make Mulsum:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the Honey:</strong> In a small saucepan, warm the honey over low heat until it becomes more liquid and easy to mix.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mix with Wine:</strong> Slowly stir the honey into the wine in a large pitcher or bowl. If you want a smoother mixture, you can heat the wine gently to help blend it better.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Spices (Optional):</strong> If you want a spiced version, add a cinnamon stick and a few peppercorns to the wine-honey mix for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Sit:</strong> Let the mixture rest for at least an hour, or longer if possible, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain and Serve: </strong> you have added spices, strain the wine before serving. Mulsum can be served chilled or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
